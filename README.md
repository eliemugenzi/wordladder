# C++ Word Ladder excercise

This is the exercise of making the possible ladder which exists between words,
A program lets a user enter the first word and destination word, then it generates the ladder between them using different C++ data structures(Stack,Queue,Set).

### _Example_:
If a user enters slow and fast, a program has to generate a ladder from slow to fast.
slow > flow > flaw > flat > fiat > fist > fast
